We are working with a multi-robot system navigating in an obstacle environment to reach their respective goal locations. The objective is to move the robots toward their goal locations while maintaining safety with obstacles, safety with each other, and inter-agent connectivity. Safety is based on agents maintaining a minimum inter-agent "safety radius" while connectivity is based on connected agents remaining within a "connectivity radius".  
Your role as the helpful assistant to provide a high-level command when the system gets stuck near obstacles. The high-level command is in terms of a leader assignment for the multi-robot system and a direction of motion for the leader. 
An optimal choice of leader and moving direction minimizes the traveling distance of agents toward their goals and maintains safety and connectivity. 
The multi-robot environment description consists of the tuple: (Number of agents, State of agents, Current inter-agent connections, Locations of their destinations, Number of visible obstacles, Locations of visible obstacles, Radii of visible obstacles, Safety radius, Connectivity radius)
The environment consists of robot Agents with information ("id"=id, "current state"=(x,y,theta), "goal location"=(xg,yg), "obstacle seen at"=(xo, yo)). In addition, there are global environment variables "Number of agents" = N, "Safety radius" = r, "Connectivity radius" = R. Agents are also connected to each other and the Connections are given as "Connected pairs" = (i,j) where i, j are Agent ids.
The task is to provide a high-level command in terms of a leader assignment for the multi-robot system and a direction of motion for the leader. The leader assignment is an integer value in the range (1, Number of agents) and the direction of motion is a string value in the range ("To goal", "To left", "To right").
The expected output is a JSON format file with the keys "Leader" and "Direction". The key "Leader" can take integer values in the range [1, Number of agents] and "Direction" in the range ("To goal", "To left", "To right").
The third value of "current state" is the orientation of the agent. If the leader is pointing in the direction of an obstacle, then the "Move direction" should be "To left" or "To right" based on whether it is able to freely move to the left or right of the obstacle. If the leader is pointing in the direction of the goal and there is no obstacle in its front, then the "Direction" should be "To goal". 
The main objective is to minimize the traveling distance of agents toward their goals. So it is important to assign the leader in such a way that the leader is pointing in the direction of the goal if there is no obstacle in its way to the goal.
An example environment description is as follows.
***NAME***Env:35***Number of agents***5***Safety radius***0.05***Connectivity radius***0.5***Agent***Id***1***current state***(3.1203148,2.2953107), ***goal location***(3.6899998,2.8300002),***obstacle seen at***[(3.25,2.30),],***Id***2***current state***(3.642762,2.0268028), ***goal location***(3.97,2.55),***obstacle seen at***[(3.64,2.13),],***Id***3***current state***(3.1975253,2.1283565), ***goal location***(3.6899998,2.55),***obstacle seen at***[(3.25,2.21),],***Id***4***current state***(3.1433043,2.467423), ***goal location***(3.97,2.8300002),***obstacle seen at***[(3.25,2.47),],***Id***5***current state***(3.1433547,2.751639), ***goal location***(3.83,2.97),***obstacle seen at***[(3.25,2.75),],***Connections***(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5),(4,5),
For the given example, the acceptable output is {"Leader": 1, "Direction": "To goal"}. An unacceptable output is {"Leader": 0, "Direction": "To goal"} since the leader should be in the range (1, 5). An unacceptable output is {"Leader": 7, "Direction": "To goal"} since the leader should be in the range (1, 5).
Next sequence of Example prompts and their correct output are from one rollout of the environment. The correct output should keep into account previous environment information and the corresponding outputs. 
In other words, the output is conditioned on the given input-output pairs from the Example prompts.
